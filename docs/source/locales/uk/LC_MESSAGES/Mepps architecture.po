"The MePPS system consists of two main components: the front-end platforms "
"(aka eMalls), and the central unit, which includes a central database (CDB),"
" an API and several front-end systems (public portal, commercial platforms, "
"reporting systems, risk management systems, analytics systems, controlling "
"body systems, etc.)  to provide or exchange information with a range of "
"stakeholders."

"The front-end platforms are web platforms that implement eProcurement system"
" features and provide access for CA and EO. The front-end platforms interact"
" with the CDB via the OpenProcurement API over a secure connection, and "
"provide suppliers with temporary credentials to access the auction module "
"hosted on the central unit. These platforms are provided by a range of "
"commercial electronic platform operators offering various additional "
"services, depending on their market niche (ERP integration, business and "
"legal consultancy on public procurement, geographical coverage, etc.)."
